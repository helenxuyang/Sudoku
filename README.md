AOOD group project (team of 7) - Sudoku game according to our teacher's requirements

To learn about the professional software development process in AOOD, our class was split into two groups of ~7-8 members to work on a large group project, and I was selected to be the team lead for my group. Starting from replying to our teacher’s request for proposal for a Sudoku application, we storyboarded, designed, developed, tested, and integrated our code together in class every day. We even held “status meetings” with our teacher once a week, meeting as a team to discuss our progress, schedule, and requirements for the project.

As team leader, I organized our goals for each day, assigned roles and tasks, and managed integration between our back-end and front-end subteams. In terms of code, I coded the core Sudoku functionality--being able to select and enter numbers using the keypad--as a basis for both the front-end and back-end groups to work off of, then aided primarily with the undo/redo functions and switching modes.
